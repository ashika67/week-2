🌱 Smart Agriculture Production Optimizing Engine

Week 2 Submission (30%)


📌 Project Overview

The Smart Agriculture Production Optimizing Engine applies machine learning for crop prediction using soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

In Week 2, the focus was on model development. Several machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated to predict the most suitable crop type.

This stage demonstrates the transition from data exploration (Week 1) to predictive modeling.

Do you also want me to prepare a formal Week 2 project report (like Week 1’s) with sections (Intro, Methodology, Results, Graphs, Conclusion), instead of just a README?
